# puzzle-alarm
to-do
- bug: rotating screens when making a new alarm (the time isn't saved)
- bug: multiple alarms only works sometimes
- kelly: instrumented UI tests
- kelly: UI for weather portion and icon for app: kelly
  

QUESTIONS:
- Do you have general recommendations for a performance NFR?
- Does improving the UI/styling count for the other NFR? (Design enhancements)
- To clarify, a unit test would be testing some method that is in our project, and an instrumented UI test would be checking if the UI is correct (log in page upon opening or a change in UI response after searching a city)
- what is a test double?
