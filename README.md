# puzzle-alarm
to-do
- kelly: UI for weather portion and icon for app: kelly
- christina: bug: rotating screens when making a new alarm (the time isn't saved)
- christina: bug: multiple alarms only works sometimes
- christina: address one performance NFR and demonstrate improvements using before and after profiler snapshots
- kelly: instrumented UI tests
  

QUESTIONS:
- Do you have general recommendations for a performance NFR?
- Does improving the UI/styling count for the other NFR? (Design enhancements)
- To clarify, a unit test would be testing some method that is in our project, and an instrumented UI test would be checking if the UI is correct (log in page upon opening or a change in UI response after searching a city)
- what is a test double?
