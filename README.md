# puzzle-alarm
to-do
- kelly: UI for weather portion and icon for app: kelly
- christina: bug: rotating screens when making a new alarm (the time isn't saved)
- christina: bug: multiple alarms only works sometimes
- christina: address one performance NFR and demonstrate improvements using before and after profiler snapshots

checkpoint 6:
- address another NFR (increased app security, design enhancements, accessibility support, localization in another language)
- three unit tests using an android test framework (JUnit). Place tests in test folder. What is "test doubles"????? (testing code units such as methods)
- three instrumented UI tests using android test framework (JUnit, Espresso, Xcode). Place tests in androidTest folder in your project directory (example: open app and login appears)
